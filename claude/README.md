# Claude peer — Go candidate

`claude-peer` runs your installed Claude with Sessionbus communication. The
integration is one Go binary and a small native plugin; it requires no Node or
npm. Claude, its login, permissions, configuration and history remain native.
Both interactive and lane paths are accepted at the documented scope below,
including installed Open, delivery, lifecycle and shared-policy checks.

## Install

Install the binary and native plugin in one step (native Claude and Sessionbus
must already be installed):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sessionbus/claude-peer/main/scripts/install-claude.sh | sh
```

The default is the latest stable release, falling back to development only
while no stable release exists. Set `SESSIONBUS_VERSION` on `sh` to select a
published release tag explicitly. The installer verifies its archive checksum
and uses the same permanent layout documented below.

Use the archive for your operating system and architecture. Development builds
are produced from the pinned repository with Go 1.24 or newer:

```sh
./scripts/package-claude "$PWD/dist"
```

Cross-build on a development host with `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`; the target host
does not need Go. Transfer the resulting archive to the target host. From the
directory containing `claude-peer-linux-amd64.tar.gz`, install in your normal
login shell:

```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude" "$HOME/.local/bin"
tar -xzf claude-peer-linux-amd64.tar.gz -C "$HOME/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude"
ln -sfn "$HOME/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/claude-peer" "$HOME/.local/bin/claude-peer"
command -v claude-peer
claude-peer --version
```

Use the matching archive filename on macOS. `$HOME/.local/bin` must be on your
normal login PATH; add it through your shell's normal startup configuration if
needed, then open a new login shell. No names or groups are installed. The
Sessionbus user service must already be installed and running through its own
installation procedure.

If replacing the earlier npm candidate, first run
`npm uninstall --global @sessionbus/claude` using that installation's actual
prefix, then install the archive above. npm is required only to remove that
old npm installation, never by the Go candidate. If the old `claude-peer` is a
regular Go binary rather than a symlink, move that exact file aside before the
link command; do not remove unrelated binaries or packages. Reinstall by
extracting the new archive into the same permanent directory and refreshing
the same public symlink. Quit integrated sessions before replacing an executing
binary. The package adds no service or global Claude plugin registration.

The installed layout is:

```text
~/.local/bin/claude-peer -> ~/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/claude-peer
~/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/claude-peer
~/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/plugin/.mcp.json
~/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/plugin/bin/sessionbus-mcp -> ../../claude-peer
~/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude/plugin/bin/sessionbus-hook -> ../../claude-peer
```

The private MCP alias invokes the same binary as the native MCP child. Lane
startup uses the private hook alias for its initial native identity report. There is
one compiled artifact, one public command and no Node/npm dependency.

## Use

```sh
claude-peer -n NAME -g GROUP
claude-peer --resume NAME -g GROUP
```

The wrapper consumes each `-g VALUE` / `--group VALUE` pair or `--group=VALUE` anywhere
before native `--`. Repeated
pairs and comma-separated values accumulate in order; no `-g` means this launch's
empty groups. `--yolo` translates to Claude's `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.
All other arguments stay ordered and unchanged after the fixed activation prefix:
`--allowedTools mcp__plugin_sessionbus_sessionbus__sessionbus --plugin-dir ROOT`.
Native `-n`, `--resume`, repeated flags and errors remain Claude's own. After
native `--`, every argument is passed through literally, including `-g` and
`--yolo`.

A caller-provided `--disallowedTools` / `--disallowed-tools` rule that names
the exact managed Sessionbus tool fails before either topology starts. Other
deny rules, values owned by other native options and operands after `--` remain
unchanged. Ambient native policy can still refuse the tool; the wrapper reports
that refusal and does not replay the call.

Ordinary `claude` stays ordinary. The wrapper loads the whole plugin only for
this launch. An unconfigured plain nested `claude` stays ordinary; use an
explicit `claude-peer` invocation with its own `-g` for an integrated child.
The one Sessionbus skill describes the actual public `sessionbus` tool. The
fixed one-tool grant coexists with `--yolo` and Claude's native
`--dangerously-skip-permissions`; unrelated native permission and sandbox
behavior stays unchanged.

Before the first native hook, the MCP owner observes Claude's own record for
its exact live parent process. Where that native registry is available, the
peer can publish its session ID before any prompt, then its name when Claude
writes it. This uses no artificial turn or extra helper process. A cwd-derived
native label is not treated as a session title.

The first usable `UserPromptSubmit`, `Stop`, or `SessionEnd` report permanently
hands identity control to the existing native hooks. A lagging registry record
cannot then republish an ended session. Later `/clear` transitions and renames
follow those hooks. If the registry is unavailable, publication still begins
from a usable native hook; no launch or first-turn deadline is guaranteed.
The bus must acknowledge publication before the peer is addressable. Missed
hook reports are not replayed.

`written` means local native socket write completion only, not native admission
or model consumption. A failure after possible submission remains uncertain.
Interactive deliveries include a structured cross-session envelope so Claude
renders the sender and message using its compact peer display. Claude's own
peer-origin guidance can still be present in model input; the integration does
not add that prose or change the message's peer attribution.
Interactive presence reconnects automatically after a daemon outage while the
native session remains alive. Calls made during the outage fail; interrupted
calls and deliveries are not replayed. Reconnection republishes the latest
native identity and title. Native session end, supersession and owner shutdown
remain terminal. Daemon-managed Worker lanes do not reconnect after losing
their launch connection.
Cancelled public waits
leave results readable through their lane/run references; cancellation does not interrupt a
native turn or retract a message.

## Lane behavior

The daemon launches this same binary as a token-selected lane worker. Use the
public Sessionbus tool: `spawn` with `product: "claude-peer"`, `name` and `open`,
then `run` or `start` with the returned `session_id` and `input`. `status`/`wait`
read a started turn without consuming it; `ack` consumes the oldest terminal
after the caller handles its state: use the result for `done`, or record/report
the reason for `unavailable` (which has no result). Never acknowledge `running`
or treat an RPC error as a retained record. References contain `session_id` and
`run_id` and remain usable by another authorized collector while that worker
lives. `interrupt` requests native interruption; `close`
ends native stdin and waits for native exit after any active interruption.
Forced failure still aborts. Resume passes that exact ID as `resume_session_id` to spawn.
No lane-specific public launcher is installed.

Open waits for native initialize, the initial root ID/title report and the
required Sessionbus tool. Open itself starts no work. The lane has no
source-proven atomic active append boundary, so every delivery is refused before
the native stream write. The daemon starts an idle message as a managed run or
retains an active-turn delivery in bounded memory for the automatic next run.
`queued_for_next_turn` is that scheduling promise, not native admission,
durability, or model consumption. Explicit and message-seeded runs return the
native terminal result and reason through the shared cursor. No Claude scheduler
or output cache is added.

Native 2.1.260 installed evidence did demonstrate same-turn lane append. It did
not establish that the replay acknowledgment can arrive independently of a
blocked tool batch or that the append is consumed across the terminal-boundary
race. The current next-run scheduling is a deliberate liveness fallback, not a
claim that same-turn delivery was never observed.

Spawn/resume policies are independent. `persistent:false` (fresh default) retires
the lane when its authenticated owner leaves; `true` survives owner exit.
`auto_close_ms` defaults to 60000 after a native completed, failed or interrupted
terminal; zero disables automatic close. An unavailable record without a native
terminal does not start a new grace.
New work cancels the old deadline; collection does not extend it. Resume
preserves persistence, but omitted
`auto_close_ms` resets to 60000. Pass zero again to keep automatic close disabled.
Persistence may be promoted, not silently demoted.

Parent-owned lanes notify their owner by default unless `notify:false` is set.
Persistent lanes need an explicit `notify_target` (or a retained target on resume
or promotion). The completion message contains a lane/run pointer and state,
never the answer. It is an ordinary peer message under the lane's identity and
starts or schedules native work under mandatory wake; interactive wake follows
the native carrier. Delivery does not prove collection. Read with `status`/`wait`, then
explicitly `ack` after using a `done` result or recording/reporting an
`unavailable` reason. Both terminal states advance the cursor only on ack.
Reads do not consume; acknowledgment is oldest-first.
Closing, automatic close or worker/daemon loss invalidates unacknowledged output.
There is no promise of answer recovery after retirement. Native saved history
and the lane's resume recipe remain separate from that transient result cursor.

With native default permissions, a lane has nobody to approve an interactive
tool request. A tool can return “requires approval” and the model can still
finish its turn successfully. The adapter does not substitute `dontAsk` or a
bypass. Callers may explicitly choose `open.permission_mode` or native
`open.arguments`; those values are passed to Claude. Prefer a rule for the
specific command needed over a broad grant. Native policy remains authoritative.
An exact launch-argument denial of the managed Sessionbus tool is rejected as
an unusable lane rather than starting a lane with communications muted.

Installed Open, public list, staging, active consumption, interruption,
configuration and independent lanes have been checked at their recorded scope.
A native Bash tool can have its own process group outside the worker group;
the daemon’s group kill does not directly reach that tool. A measured hard
worker kill left it alive, and the earlier forced close path also left a tool
alive after an interrupted terminal. With the corrected EOF close path, both
the tool and its parent were absent after held interruption and after held
close. This does not fix forced-death containment. Pending-wait cancellation,
forwarder loss and interactive operation on the same build have also been
checked; each result and its limits are in the product facts. Generic
forced-death descendant cleanup remains open.

## Remove

After quitting integrated sessions, remove the exact owned launcher symlink
and package directory:

```sh
rm "$HOME/.local/bin/claude-peer"
rm -r "$HOME/.local/libexec/sessionbus/claude"
```

Check that these paths still name this installation before removing them.
Keep ordinary Claude, its history/configuration, other plugins and the
Sessionbus service. The integration creates no separate persistent data store.

The reviewed Node implementation at `9644348`, including C01–C03 regressions,
is retained under `docs/designs/claude-0.5.0/node-reference` as a behavioral
reference. It is not included in this installed archive. Existing native facts
remain version-qualified evidence; the Go translation requires its own actual
installed acceptance. Source tests alone do not establish that acceptance.

When orchestrating another product, use the tool identifier and argument envelope
from the orchestrator's installed declaration. Use the selected lane product's
`describe` response and skill/README for its open fields, native permissions,
receipts and lifecycle. See the [shared delivery guidance](../README.md#delivery-and-presence)
for receipt uncertainty and the limits of presence flags.
